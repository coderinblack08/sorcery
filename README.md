# 🧙‍♂️ Sorcery

> "Yet Another Digital Garden, But Magical"

Sorcery aims to be a easier, more lightweight alternative to Obsidian.
Currently, the goal is support both a self-hosted and deployed version.

## Installation

<!-- - Run `docker compose up` to launch a local d-graph database. -->

- Run `pnpm install` and `pnpm dev` to launch the web app.
